Improved Blizzard UI (Battle for Azeroth Edition)
====================

### Please note that due to me no longer playing Battle for Azeroth this is not currently maintained any longer.

Improved Blizzard UI is an attempt to improve the World of Warcraft interface by styling frames, implementing additional functionality and restructuring / hiding existing elements.

This has been customized to out of the box be how I personally like my UI set up however there is extensive configuration available in game by using `/imp`. This interface is primarily tested at 2560x1400 but should largely work at any resolution.
